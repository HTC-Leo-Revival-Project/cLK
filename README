3. How To
=================

3.1 Flash cLK
--------------

- make sure you have hspl
- enter SPL by holding VOL DOWN key while powering/resting the phone.
- flash with customruu like you would a windows rom and/or magldr

Flash a ROM
- download android sdk (or rather, just adb, drivers and fastboot)
- fastboot flash recovery recovery.img
- after recovery you can reboot and use CWM or you can flash with fastboot 
  (fastboot flash boot boot.img, fastboot flash system system.img, fastboot flash userdata userdata.img)

Start recovery / fastboot / text console
- holding down any key ( except power ) will show text console
- home key will enter recovery ( if flashed )
- back key will enter fastboot mode
